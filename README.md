<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started
To get started, first of all go to the official site of Bootstrap and copy the CDN Links then proceed by pasting them in your html file. 

## Installation
After pasting the CDN Links, we will use various features in Bootstrap such as Buttons, Cards, Gutters, and much more.

* CDN Links

  ```sh
      <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-KK94CHFLLe+nY2dmCWGMq91rCGa5gtU4mk92HdvYe+M/SXH301p5ILy+dN9+nJOZ" crossorigin="anonymous">
